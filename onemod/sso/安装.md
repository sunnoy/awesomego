# Keycloak server
For this example, I will use the official keycloak docker image to start the server. The version used is 4.1.0.Final. I think this will work with older KeyCloak versions too though.

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e KEYCLOAK_USER=keycloak -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=k --name keycloak jboss/keycloak:4.1.0.Final
```
After the server is up and running, you can open localhost:8080/auth in your browser, navigate to the administration console and login with username keycloak and k as the corresponding password.

I will not go through the complete process of creating a realm/clients/users. You can look this up under https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#admin-console

Here is just an outline for what I did to reproduce this example:

## create a realm named demo
官方参考文档
https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#oidc-clients
- turn off the requirement of ssl for this realm (realmsettings -> login -> require ssl)
- create a client named demo-client (change the "Access Type" to confidential)
- create a user named demo with password demo (users -> add user). Make sure to activate and impersonate this user.
- configure the demo-client to be confidential and use http://localhost:8181/demo/callback as a valid redirect URI.
